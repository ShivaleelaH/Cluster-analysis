# Cluster-analysis

Tasks:

The task of this project is to perform cluster analysis on fashion MNIST dataset using unsupervised learning. Cluster analysis is one of the unsupervised machine learning technique which doesnâ€™t require labeled data.

Your task will be that of clustering images and identify it as one of many clusters. You are required to train your unsupervised model using Fashion-MNIST clothing images. Following are the three tasks to be performed:

1. Use KMeans algorithm to cluster original data space of Fashion-MNIST dataset using Sklearns library.

2. Build an Auto-Encoder based K-Means clustering model to cluster the condensed representation of the unlabeled fashion MNIST dataset using Keras and Sklearns library.

3. Build an Auto-Encoder based Gaussian Mixture Model clustering model to cluster the condensed representation of the unlabeled fashion MNIST dataset using Keras and Sklearns library.

4. Report the clustering accuracy for each of the task.
